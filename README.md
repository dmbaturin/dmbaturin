I'm a maintainer of [VyOS](https://vyos.io), an IT generalist, and a functional programming enthusiast.

My biggest side project at this time is [soupault](https://soupault.neocities.org): an unconventional, UNIX-way static site generator that works with the HTML element tree rather than templates, so you can pipe the content of `<pre>` or `<code>` tags through a syntax highlighter of your choice for example.

Work in progress, needs your contributions:
* A [free culture OCaml textbook](https://ocamlbook.org) ([dmbaturin/ocaml-book](https://github.com/dmbaturin/ocaml-book))

If you find my projects helpful, consider buying me a [metaphorical coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dmbaturin).
