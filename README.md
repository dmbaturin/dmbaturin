I'm a maintainer of [VyOS](https://vyos.net), an IT generalist, and a functional programming enthusiast.

My biggest side project at this time is [soupault](https://soupault.app): an unconventional, UNIX-way static site generator that can manipulate HTML element trees rather than just generate HTML from templates.
You can pipe the content of `<pre>` or `<code>` tags through a syntax highlighter of your choice, render KaTeX statically, and more.

Work in progress, needs your contributions:
* ["OCaml From the Ground Up"](https://ocamlbook.org)â€”a free culture (CC-BY-SA) OCaml textbook. ([dmbaturin/ocamlbook.org](https://github.com/dmbaturin/ocamlbook.org))

If you find my projects helpful, consider buying me a [metaphorical coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dmbaturin).
